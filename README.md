# poplar_GWAS_photosyn
poplar photosynthesis and genomci predictions

The goal of the project is to use genomic predictions to decrease the uncertainty surrounding parameter value estimates in FvCB. In turn, this will also provide biodesign targets for plant productivity. 

Parts of the project:
1) phenotype estimates
2) population genetics
3) photosynthesis model
4) genomic predictions of parameter values
5) photosynthesis simulations
